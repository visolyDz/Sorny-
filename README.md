Sourny — Professional Static Package
===================================

This package contains a ready-to-deploy static site for Sourny:

Files:
- index.html (landing)
- login.html
- dashboard.html
- css/styles.css
- js/app.js
- assets/ (place images here)

How to publish on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repository (example: sourny).
2. Upload all files/folders to the repository root (index.html, css/, js/, assets/).
3. In repository Settings -> Pages: set Source to 'main' branch and folder '/' (root) -> Save.
4. Wait 30–60s, then open: https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/

Notes:
- This is a static demo. Login/dashboard are front-end only and use localStorage for demo purposes.
- Customize texts, replace assets and add backend later if needed.
